# Developing microservices with Kotlin

This repository contains the source code used for the blog post `Developing Microservices in Kotlin: Part-I to Part-V`.
There are two microservices:

- **shop-user-service**: This service handles shop user data
- **shop-item-service**: This service handles shop item data
- **shop-deployment**: Contains the deployment script - docker compose

## Run the application

Build the jar for each service and then build its image with tag. Refer to deployment and services readme files.
